Perl script to process WSC's emails and create a CSV with past information


After a major sql server failure at our sister company I slapped together this (ugly) script to convert their donation thank-you letters back
into the data from whence they came.  This could all have been done much more gracefully with regex but my regex is too rusty to slap together 
in 2 hours.
